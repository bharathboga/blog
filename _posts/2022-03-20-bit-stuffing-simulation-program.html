        <p>Bit stuffing is a method in which stream of bits is broken into frames. The process of breaking a stream of bits into frames is called as framing.</p>
        <p>Why is framing required ?<br>
        Framing is the traditional way involved in data link layer to detect errors in the stream of bits. Bit stream received by data link layer is not always error free because there may be noise in channel through which the bits are transferred.</p>

        <p>In bit stuffing, a flag byte is used which is a bit pattern that indicates the start and end of a frame. The bit pattern used is 01111110. However, there are chances that the pattern may occur within the stream of bits. In such cases, at the data link layer of sender, whenever 5 consecutive 1&rsquo;s are encountered, a 0 bit is stuffed (added). And on the receiver side, whenever 5 consecutive 1&rsquo;s are encountered, a 0 bit is destuffed (removed).</p>
